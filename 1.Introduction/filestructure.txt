from the root directory, we have 3 ts files that are generated when we create the project.
NB: Angular uses typescript and not javascript

tsconfig.spec.json - will hold the unit testing files that will be in uses
tsconfig.json - the main ts configuration file. 
Readme.md - will be utilised by github. 
package.json = gives us the name, version and scripts of the project
            the scripts contain key values that hold commands that can be executed. 
            An example is the start command, which has been tied to ng serve, the command used to run your angular project.
            To run ng serve, you can use npm run start
            The dependencies section holds all the internal packages that will be used in the project.
            Devdependencies will hold packages that will be used only during development. 
angular.json - you can change and modify the angular configuration from here. 
node_modules folder - All dependencies declared in the package.json folder will be installed here. 
src folder - This will hold all the angular code that we will be writing
------src files start here ------
    style.scss - global styles
    main.ts - the main page that will run when the application starts.
    index.html - runs by default at the start whenever a project is running. 
    assets folder - The assets folder will contain all the images that will be used in the app. 
    app folder 
        app.modules.ts - will hold all the modules that will be used in the project
